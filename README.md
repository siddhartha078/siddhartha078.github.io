Welcome to my personal cybersecurity lab and learning journal!

This GitHub Pages site serves as a **portfolio**, **blog**, and **knowledge base** where I share my learning journey, lab simulations, tool walkthroughs, and certifications as an aspiring self-taught cybersecurity analyst.

- Packet capture & analysis using **Wireshark**
- Port scanning with **Nmap**
- Exploiting vulnerable VMs using **Metasploit**
- Phishing simulations using **Zphisher** and **BlackEye**
- Completed **Googleâ€™s Cybersecurity Certificate**

I'm currently exploring platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box.
