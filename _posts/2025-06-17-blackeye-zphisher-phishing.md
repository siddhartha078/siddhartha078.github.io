## Objective

Simulate a phishing attack using BlackEye on a local VM to understand how credential harvesting works.

---

## Tools Used

- BlackEye, Zphisher  
- Kali Linux(VM)  
- Localhost setup (VM)

---

## Steps

1. Cloned BlackEye, Zphisher repositories from GitHub
2. Launched the phishing page for Instagram,Netflix
3. Used a tunnel to expose localhost (Ngrok, localxpose, etc.)
4. Opened the phishing page on victim browser
5. Captured the login credentials in terminal

---

## Observations

- Most kits just use HTML/CSS clones of login pages
- BlackEye stores creds in plain text
- Some pages are broken/outdated

---

## Takeaways

- Never trust links â€” always verify domains
- Tools like these are good for **defenders to understand attacker techniques**
- Real-world phishing often uses shortened or hidden URLs
